The goal of this project to create a table dynamically based upon a dataset provided. 
It allows our users to filter the table data for specific values. 
Use pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js 

This project used JavaScript and DOM Manipulation to display alien sightings from a very large dataset. 
Users can search the data using various filtering criteria and pages through the results.
Your Task

Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 

•	It has been created a basic HTML web page
•	Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, 
write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
o	Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.
•	Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
